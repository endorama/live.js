# Live.js

[Live.js](http://livejs.com/) is a JavaScript written by [Martin Kool](http://twitter.com/mrtnkl) to autoreload the page when an included script source ( CSS, JS or HTML itself ) is updated.

I forked their version because I couldn't find the source code hosted anywhere to integrate some bug fixes.

## Example

Sample usage: include live.js file in html

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="live.js"></script>
```
